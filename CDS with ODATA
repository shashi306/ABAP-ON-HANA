CDS provides another magical strength to the users to expose the views as OData services. 
There is a conventional way to create a service in SEGW importing the view you created.

Syntax at heading line:  @OData.publish: true.

Note, once you activate the view at heading “@OData.Publish: true” 
which reads that you need to register the service through /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE

Now, as instructed go to transaction /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE in the gateway system to register
 the service created through CDS.

Once the service is found, click on the service to register and save it in the appropriate package.
Note we have not used SEGW to create any service. This service got automatically generated due to 
OData Annotation maintained.

Now test your service through /IWFND/GW_CLIENT transaction using proper OData query. Note, for 
navigation unlike usual gateway, we are using ‘to_<association name>’ in the query to navigate to the
second data set. Since we created vbeln as an association condition in our ‘ZTEST_ASSOC_VIEW2’
the value needs to be passed through OData query for data fetching.

Limitations
Please also be informed that this service can only provide GET operation. No other CRUD operations
 can be done with this CDS view OData Exposure.

Usually, CDS views are created for fetching data (GET operations) and therefore even with the above
limitation, this method of exposing CDS views as OData service is very helpful. 
This also shows the power of Annotations (New SQL) in the Core Data Services.

Example:
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZV_ODATA_DEMO'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'OData service on ABAP CDS View'
@OData.publish: true

define view ZODATA_DEMO as select from scarr 
{
key carrid      as AirlineCode,
    carrname    as AirlineName,
    currcode    as Currency,
    url         as AirlineURL
}

CDS view should meet following rules for successful OData service generation.

No syntax errors in DDL source code.
At least one key element is defined in the SELECT list of the CDS view.
The name of the CDS view should not exceed 26 characters in length.

With Parameters:-
----------------

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZV_ODATA_DEMO_P'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'OData service on ABAP CDS View'

@OData.publish: true
define view ZODATA_DEMO_PARAMS 
with parameters p_carrid :S_CARR_ID
as select from scarr 

{
key carrid      as AirlineCode,
    carrname    as AirlineName,
    currcode    as Currency,
    url         as AirlineURL
} 
where carrid = $parameters.p_carrid( this is from screen field).
