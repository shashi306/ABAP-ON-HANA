1) SQL Monitor: Analyzes the SQL profile of processes.(no information about the code execution flow(stack trace)).
2) ABAP Test Cockpit: Detects source code with optimization potential( no information about if and how often code
   is actually executed).
3) For a full runtime analysis, you can use the ABAP Trace (SAT) or the ABAP Profiling perspective in the ABAP
Development Tools for Eclipse.
